# interactive_plot
Script for making an interactive plot in python. 
<br>
<br>
This will make a scatter plot of your data. When you click on one of the points, a label for the point will show up on the plot, and any associated images will pop up in a separate window. Very useful for visualizing data from simulations!

I have made up four images that will be pulled up everytime a point on the graph is clicked. Obviously, this should be changed to whatever images you want to pull up for your data.

Some basic functions were found on stackoverflow, but were adjusted slightly by myself.
