# interactive_plot
Script for making an interactive plot in python.

This will make a scatter plot of your data. When you click on one of the points, a label for the point will show up on the plot, and any associated images will pop up in a separate window. Very useful for visualizing data from simulations!

Some basic functions were found on stackoverflow, but were adjusted slightly by myself.
